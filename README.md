# Learning Assembly Language Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my learning assembly language repository! I'm Merveilles Katumba, and this is where I embark on a journey to understand the intricate workings of computers. You can reach me via email at [merveilleskatumba@gmail.com](mailto:merveilleskatumba@gmail.com).

## Purpose
The primary objective of this repository is to deepen my comprehension of computers through the exploration of assembly language. By delving into assembly, I aim to grasp the foundational principles governing computer architecture and programming.

## Learning Approach
I'll be leveraging various learning resources, including YouTube videos and free online books, to grasp assembly language concepts. Additionally, I'll engage in hands-on learning by crafting both simple and complex projects. Step-by-step tutorials will guide me through this process, ensuring a structured and comprehensive understanding of assembly language.

## Exploration
In my pursuit of knowledge, I'll also venture into the realm of reverse engineering. This entails dissecting existing programs to unravel their inner workings, further enriching my understanding of assembly language and its practical applications.

## Repository Structure
Expect to find an organized repository with distinct folders dedicated to specific aspects of assembly language and related projects. As I progress, I may explore different assembly languages like ARM, RISC, and more, leading to a diverse range of content within the repository.
